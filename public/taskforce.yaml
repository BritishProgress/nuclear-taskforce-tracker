    title: 'Overview and Objectives of the Taskforce'
    summary: |
      Introduces why the Nuclear Regulatory Taskforce was set up and what it was asked to do: review the civil and defence nuclear regulatory system and recommend reforms that make projects faster and cheaper while maintaining – not weakening – safety. It explains the remit, the focus on regulation rather than industrial strategy or financing, and the main principles guiding the work (proportionality, clarity, system-level thinking, practical delivery).

      It also describes how the Taskforce worked: evidence-gathering from departments, regulators, industry and international comparators; site visits; and commissioned analysis. The chapter then lays out the structure of the report and signals that later sections will move from context, to diagnosis, to concrete recommendations and implementation.

    title: 'Nuclear in the UK'
    summary: |
      Sets out the UK nuclear landscape in historical and current terms. It traces the UK’s early leadership (first grid-connected station, pioneering civil and defence programmes) and then the subsequent decline: an ageing fleet, stalled or cancelled projects, and a loss of industrial capability. It maps the main parts of the sector – civil generation, defence (deterrent and submarines), decommissioning and waste, and the wider supply chain.

      The chapter then looks ahead: expected growth in electricity demand (including from AI and electrification), the need for firm low-carbon power for net zero, and the role of nuclear in energy security and national security. Nuclear is framed as a strategic capability that underpins cheap, reliable power, supports high-value jobs, and anchors the independent deterrent.
  - id: 3
    title: 'Regulation of Nuclear Activities in the UK'
    summary: |
      Summarises how nuclear activities are regulated today and the key concepts that underpin the system. It explains the goal-based approach (dutyholders must demonstrate safety rather than simply follow prescriptive rules), ALARP and ALARA principles, Best Available Techniques, and the core legal instruments such as the Nuclear Installations Act, Health and Safety at Work Act, Ionising Radiations Regulations and Environmental Permitting Regulations.

      The chapter also maps the institutional landscape: ONR, DNSR, the Environment Agency and equivalents in the devolved nations, planning authorities, and central government departments. It describes processes such as safety cases, Generic Design Assessment and Justification, and shows how multiple overlapping regimes shape what happens on nuclear sites.
  - id: 4
    title: 'Summary of the Problem'
    summary: |
      Provides the central diagnosis of why nuclear projects in the UK are so slow and expensive. Regulation is described as a complex, multi-layer system where decisions are taken not just by regulators but by departments, dutyholders and courts, often influenced by international standards and fear of judicial review. Over time, this has created duplication, unclear accountability, and a pattern of highly conservative decisions that do not obviously improve safety in proportion to their cost.

      Five clusters of issues are highlighted: a risk-averse reading of ALARP; decommissioning and waste approaches that assume very stringent end-states and move slowly on the Geological Disposal Facility; cumbersome Habitats and Environmental Impact Assessment processes; a planning regime that adds long pre-application and examination phases; and cultural and capacity weaknesses that entrench “gold-plating” and slow decision-making. The conclusion is that marginal tweaks will not be enough: a system-level reset is needed.
  - id: 5
    title: "Simplification of Nuclear Regulation"
    summary: |
      Develops proposals to simplify the institutional and legal landscape. It argues that the current fragmentation – multiple regulators on the same site, overlapping powers, differing standards and heavy use of consultants – drives complexity and slows decisions. A more unified structure is proposed, with clearer lines of accountability and a single place where big regulatory calls are made.

      Key ideas include: moving towards a one-stop model for nuclear safety regulation; designating a lead regulator when more than one body is involved; and ultimately legislating for a Commission for Nuclear Regulation – a collective body responsible for major regulatory decisions. Government’s role is to set strategic direction, resolve cross-cutting policy conflicts, and provide a coherent national framework rather than leaving regulators to navigate those tensions alone.
  - id: 6
    title: "Risk Management & Proportionality"
    summary: |
      Examines how risk is interpreted and managed in the UK system, particularly the ALARP principle and the Tolerability of Risk (TOR) framework. The analysis suggests that ALARP has drifted towards a one-sided focus on minimising risk without enough weight on what is “reasonably practicable”, and that some radiological dose and risk targets are set more stringently than in peer countries. Qualitative, conservative judgements often dominate over explicit cost-benefit analysis, and portfolio-level trade-offs (e.g. across a defence programme or the decommissioning estate) are weak.

      The chapter proposes clarifying in law what proportionality means for HSWA duties, updating key guidance such as R2P2, and making more systematic use of explicit risk–cost balancing. It also returns to the Three Lines of Defence concept to re-establish clear roles for management, independent assurance and regulators. Another theme is separating truly nuclear hazards from conventional ones on nuclear sites, so that nuclear-grade standards are only applied where justified by the nature of the risk.
  - id: 7
    title: "Environmental Assessments & Permitting"
    summary: |
      Looks at how environmental law interacts with nuclear projects. While reaffirming the importance of robust protection for habitats and species, the chapter argues that current practice around Habitats Regulations Assessments and EIAs has become duplicative, slow and excessively risk-averse. Fear of legal challenge and an insistence on site-specific micro-mitigation can lead to huge expenditure and physical interventions that may add little to overall environmental outcomes.

      Proposed reforms include creating an alternative compliance route via substantial contributions to a new nature fund in place of elaborate on-site mitigation, streamlining and sequencing environmental assessments so that major issues are resolved once rather than repeatedly, improving access to environmental data, and introducing statutory timelines and clearer guidance on Biodiversity Net Gain. There is also a discussion of judicial review and costs, with suggestions to maintain scrutiny but reduce the chilling effect on timely decision-making.
  - id: 8
    title: "The Planning System"
    summary: |
      Describes how planning, especially the NSIP regime, affects nuclear projects. The system, intended to speed up major infrastructure, is portrayed as lengthy and procedurally heavy, with long pre-application periods, overlapping assessments and limited flexibility to adapt projects once an application is submitted. It is also largely designed around large, bespoke nuclear stations rather than a future that may involve smaller or modular reactors and a fleet-based rollout.

      The chapter recommends giving nuclear and certain associated projects (like the GDF) clearly prioritised status in national planning policy, simplifying Development Consent Orders, and modernising population density and planning zone criteria to reflect current reactor safety characteristics. It also suggests more proportionate treatment for early investigative works such as boreholes. Many of the proposed changes are framed as potentially beneficial precedents for other critical low-carbon infrastructure.
  - id: 9
    title: "Culture, Capacity, Capability, & Innovation"
    summary: |
      Shifts focus from rules and institutions to people, behaviours and skills. It argues that culture across the sector – in regulators, government and industry – has a direct impact on safety, cost and timeliness. A narrow interpretation of “safety first” can crowd out consideration of time and cost even where delays also carry risks (e.g. to energy security). Leadership attention to organisational culture, and better tools for assessing and managing it, are identified as crucial.

      The chapter also highlights workforce challenges: shortages of experienced specialists, an ageing workforce, constraints on pay and conditions in regulatory bodies, and heavy reliance on contractors. It calls for implementation of national nuclear skills plans, stronger non-technical skills, and more movement of staff between organisations. Finally, it notes slow uptake of digital tools, data-centric engineering, robotics and AI, and proposes targeted programmes to embed these technologies in design, construction, operation and regulation.
  - id: 10
    title: "International Harmonisation"
    summary: |
      Sets nuclear regulation in an international context. Many countries are expanding nuclear, but regulatory approaches differ significantly, creating complexity and cost for reactor designs deployed across borders. The UK experience with adapting foreign designs, such as for Hinkley Point C, is used to illustrate how bespoke national requirements can drive up cost and delay without necessarily improving safety.

      The chapter advocates a more strategic UK role in international harmonisation. Suggestions include making systematic use of other trusted regulators’ assessments, conducting joint reviews, focusing UK effort on genuinely local or site-specific issues, and strengthening the UK’s voice in international standards-setting. It also looks at export controls, arguing that current licensing is slow and overly complex for low-risk exports, and recommends a more risk-based regime, time-limited licences and open licences for regulators to support global collaboration while maintaining non-proliferation commitments.
  - id: 11
    title: "Additional Recommendations and Issues"
    summary: |
      Collects a set of important cross-cutting topics that do not sit neatly in earlier chapters. One major theme is ONR’s funding and charging model: recovering costs “to the penny” from dutyholders limits ONR’s ability to invest in its own capacity, build reserves or engage internationally, and creates uncertainty for industry. A more flexible, predictable model is proposed.

      Other themes include the need for a later review of the Nuclear Installations Act to support novel applications (such as nuclear propulsion at sea), the distorting effect of cost-plus contracts and weak financial incentives on the extent of “gold-plating”, and issues around nuclear liability, insurance and interactions with non-Convention states. The chapter also touches on site availability, approaches to releasing land for new projects, novel nuclear applications (shipping, space, radioisotopes), and the potential of modularisation to cut cost and time in both new build and decommissioning.

This should be clearly communicated to regulators and periodically reviewed.

      The Government should make a direction to the ONR under section 92 of the Energy Act 2013 and to the EA section 40 of the Environment Act 1995 so that, in exercising their functions, risks at or below broadly acceptable levels are deemed to be ALARP and ALARA unless there are strong and compelling reasons to the contrary.

      Regulators should undertake an immediate review of numerical targets set in their guidance. This review should ensure alignment with the government definitions of tolerability and their application. It should also align with levels set internationally.

      Regulatory guidance should be thoroughly reviewed to ensure it is consistent with a primarily non-prescriptive regulatory system. The updates to this guidance should:
      a) Re-establish the role of SAPs/TAGs as guidance to inspectors;
      b) Ensure consistency across the TAGs and ensure greater focus on implementing the safety principles in the SAPs rather than specific implementation practices; and
      c) Set the expectation that it for dutyholders, not regulators, to identify applicable RGP and BAT including those from other high-hazard sectors. Challenge to what constitutes RGP should be proportionate to the risks, and the relevance of the practice.

      Government should propose secondary legislation under section 50 of HSWA which clarifies the law. The test should not be whether a measure is grossly disproportionate, but instead what is proportionate taking into account a multi-faceted consideration of the level of risk.

      This secondary legislation should confirm that whether an action is proportionate to that risk shall be established by reference to:
      a) the nature of the hazard concerned;
      b) the likelihood of that hazard occurring;
      c) the scale of the potential impact in terms of the degree of harm and the numbers of individuals who might reasonably foreseeably be affected;
      d) the cost, time and difficulty involved;
      e) any relevant policy guidance established by the Secretary of State or the relevant regulator; and
      f) whether undertaking the measure might prevent a desirable activity from taking place (either at all, to a particular extent, or in a particular way).

      R2P2 should be updated to reflect this secondary legislation and err on the side of proportionality, taking into account the nature of the risk.

      c) Make clear, through an interpretive provision, that "likely significant effects" does not require complete, as opposed to proportionate, data about a potential impact.
      d) Affirm the Rochdale Envelope. It should be acceptable to grant consent while some surveys or design details are still outstanding. Worst-case assumptions should be case-specific and evidence-based, not drawn automatically from stricter precedents elsewhere.
      e) Where there is a dispute about the level of surveys or assessments, the Secretary of State should, as part of any DCO decision, specify the most proportionate level they consider acceptable to set expectations for future decisions and projects. The Secretary of State should, when giving such guidance, have significant regard to the potential for delay and cost on development.

    text: |
      MHCLG should legislate to allow the development of “Modular Low-Carbon Acceleration Zones” and utilise the approach for existing nuclear defence sites and GBE-N sites where multiple reactors are, or could be, proposed. The approach taken in Germany (noted above) in relation to wind development is useful. An approach like this could be beneficial in England. A proposed outline would be as follows:
      a) Assessment and Zone Creation: The promoter, developer, or government must carry out a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) for areas chosen for new nuclear projects. This assessment, based on the maximum parameters, will highlight which parts of the area could be most affected by development. This defines a ‘zone’.
      b) Plan: After the assessment and a period for public feedback, the Secretary of State will create a plan for the zone. This plan will set rules to reduce environmental harm, such as keeping development away from sensitive sites or limiting building heights. It will also decide how much developers must pay to make up for any remaining environmental impacts. Natural England will use this money for conservation or improvement projects in the area.
      c) Approval: The Secretary of State can only approve the plan if it clearly improves overall environmental outcomes, considering the benefits of nuclear power for Net Zero and climate change.
      d) Developer Contributions: Developers must pay a fee based on either the size of the development zone or the amount of energy the project will produce.
      e) Simplified Assessments Requirements: After the Secretary of State successfully designates a plan, developers no longer need to produce individual Environmental Impact Assessments and Habitats Regulations Assessments (if Recommendation 12) is not accepted) for any developments brought forward in the zone. Instead, individual projects must just be compliant with the plan and pay any required environmental contributions as their project progresses.
      f) Sensitive Sites Excluded: This system does not apply to development directly in highly sensitive areas like ancient woodlands, National Parks, or National Landscapes.
      g) Planning Acceptance: If a plan exists, any negative impacts from development are considered acceptable for planning purposes, unless there are highly exceptional circumstances.

    text: |
      Following consultation with the Lord Chancellor, enact the following changes to the operation of the existing cost caps:
      a) Where the court determines, in any part of the proceedings, that there has been a "misuse of judicial review", there should be an automatic removal of the costs protection. This should be coupled with a requirement that the counsel and solicitors certify, as part of a claim, that the grounds have a more likely than not chance of success.
      b) The cost cap is raised to take account of inflation since 2013 and linked to inflation going forward. Courts should, in addition, be issued guidance which encourages them to set higher caps, or maximally utilise their discretion, where there is a misuse of the process or where it is clear the intent is to delay development.
      c) The cost cap be cascaded, being doubled for each stage of a challenge (e.g. from £10,000 at the first instance to £20,000 at the Court of Appeal).
      d) Where crowd funding is utilised, the cap should be set at 70% of total funds raised (e.g. £70,000 if a campaigning group has raised £100,000 for a legal action). We consider that 70% represents a figure which balances access to justice, and the need for nuclear development without delay.
      e) The costs cap for the decision-maker being challenged should always be set at a level which is at least 5 times the claimant’s cap in order to balance the relationship between a challenger and the decision-maker.
      If necessary, prior to the enactment of the above, amend the Aarhus Convention under Article 14 of the Convention which endorse the principle of the measures above. If the principle of these measures is not endorsed, the UK should dispute any findings against it. Ongoing membership to the Convention is a matter for the UK Government.
      The principle of a ‘single bite of the cherry’, and the above measures, should be extended beyond just NSIPs to nuclear site licensing and permitting decisions. If claimants lose on an issue relating to the DCO, they should not be able to appeal to the Court of Appeal.

    text: |
      a) DEFRA to amend the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016 (EPRs) to create an exemption for stockpiling materials on an existing nuclear site subject to generic conditions. This should be agreed between the NDA, and the Secretary of State. This system should be in place by end of December 2026.
      b) DESNZ legislates for “constrained discretion” in the context of decommissioning activities (covering the EPRs, CDM and other legislation). Should there be a circumstance in which an activity concerns multiple regulators, a single lead regulator should be designated to make a decision. Using their constrained discretion, a lead regulator should be able to grant approvals where inconsistencies across regulations apply, taking into account overarching outcomes.
      c) Nuclear Reactors (Environmental Impact Assessment for Decommissioning) Regulations be amended to avoid the need for duplicative assessments. Government must legislate to ensure there is no more than one Environmental Impact Assessment. In tandem, the Government should seek an amendment to the Aarhus Convention to ensure that there can be no finding against the UK in respect of this change.
      d) Going forward, there should only be a requirement to comply with guidance that existed at the outset of an assessment unless otherwise exceptionally specified. More specifically, the EA should not require the application of an updated GRA for LLWRs in relation to the ESC prepared for the GRA and that a proportionate and enabling approach is taken to reviewing updates to the ESC.
      e) MHCLG should amend the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 to include Permitted Development Rights which are granted to the NDA. These rights should be equivalent to powers granted to statutory undertakers.

      The Secretary of State for Housing, Communities & Local Government should update the NPPF to contain the same CNP presumption.

      MHCLG should issue guidance that:
        a) Requires consideration of project importance when deciding on acceptance;
        b) Secures the benefits of removing statutory consultation; and
        c) Encourages continuous improvement in examination timescales and proportionality.
      Statutory guidance should:
        a) Expressly confirm that consultation and engagement should not be assessed during the acceptance phase; the scope and approach to consultation should be left to the developer’s discretion. There should be no obligation to provide a draft EIA as part of consultation. Guidance may recognise the benefits of consultation but it should not create an expectation that it must always occur;
        b) Establish a strong presumption that pre-examination periods are expected to finish in under four months. For projects designated as critical national priorities, rejection at the acceptance stage should only occur if there is strong evidence that any deficiencies identified at the application submission stage cannot be remedied within that presumptive pre-examination period;
        c) Affirm the test on whether an application is accepted for examination should simply be a validation exercise, whereby the Inspectorate should consider whether the required application documents have been submitted. The test on whether those application documents are "satisfactory" must require fundamental issues with the application documents;
        d) Establish that where a project is designated as a critical national priority, a decision on whether to refuse an application for development consent at the acceptance stage can only be made by the Secretary of State of the relevant department. Where the Planning Inspectorate suggests a project should be refused, it must communicate the basis of its conclusions to the applicant, providing a reasonable period for the applicant to respond. That information alone should be provided to the relevant Secretary of State who will take a decision on whether to refuse the application;
        e) Affirm there must be compelling evidence to re-examine an issue or approach where that particular issue or approach has a precedent in a previous DCO application and that has been approved by the Secretary of State;
        f) Establish the examination period should be shorter if a technology has previously been consented unless there are significant issues. The examining authority should seek approval from the relevant Secretary of State where an examination is proposed to be longer than the same technology as compared to the shortest precedent;
        g) Provide that an interested party should be liable for costs where it raises the same matter, with no new substance (excluding signposting).
      MHCLG should update the Planning Inspectorate’s Framework Document to reflect the above.

      Government should legislate that there should be an automatic grant of planning permission if no decision is made within 8 weeks for applications which continue to be made to local authorities.

      It should, using powers under the Planning and Infrastructure Bill, restrict the refusal of planning applications for nuclear and nuclear-related development which continue to be made to local authorities.

      DESNZ should amend EN-7 to include a statement that where adverse effects arise as a result of the adoption of a fleet approach, the adverse impact will not be a basis for refusal unless exceptional circumstances apply. It is critical that this position is not diluted through additional hurdles.

      The policy should expressly state that there is very large weight to be attached to the policy of standardisation. The test should make clear that if an adverse impact results from an approach already accepted in a previous application the "starting points" in relation to the CNP should also apply.

This process should oblige the Government (or, if established, the Commission) to confirm that it has no objections in principle to a given proposal, in light of the safety which can be assured via the nuclear site licensing, and REPPIR19.

      The ONR should revise SUPDC to account for scientific and technological progress since the original system was created.

      ONR and UKHSA should be asked to calculate revised default Outline Planning Zones (OPZs) for reactors of differing types and sizes, based on best scientific information. These would not prevent developers from proposing smaller OPZs if warranted. This should, in turn, be used to amend the default distances in Schedule 5 of REPPIR19. Regulations should further be amended that distances in excess of the new defaults cannot be imposed without the consent of the Secretary of State or Commission (if established).

      Government should amend the regulations to allow for an appeals process to the Secretary of State or the Commission (if established) in the event of local authority determinations on DEPZs which are disputed. In addition, regulation 8 of REPPIR19 should be amended to impose a fixed time limit of 12 weeks for determination and only allow re-determination with the consent of the ONR, or the Commission (if established).

      The GDF, and associated site investigation development, is given "Critical National Priority" status by MHCLG in both the National Policy Statement, and either the NPPF or National Development Management Policy.

      Government propose primary legislation which grants the NDA (and any member of the NDA group) the ability to promote a Compulsory Purchase Order and that the NDA (and any member of the NDA group) is deemed to have statutory undertaker status.

      MHCLG amends the GPDO to grant a permitted development right to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority to carry out surveys similar to the survey powers found in Part 17 Class J and K of Sch 2 of the GPDO.

      If the Government accepts the above recommendations DESNZ should confirm that an alternative planning route for the borehole investigations does provide value for money. Our strong expectation is that a DCO is not proportionate for boreholes.

      Government should make a direction under the Energy Act 2013 to the ONR that it should maximise the leverage of existing regulatory reviews approved by other trusted national regulators. This should establish that the ONR is justified in relying on the approvals from states where there are formal working arrangements, such as Memoranda of Understanding. The direction should establish a strong presumption, without prejudice to regulatory independence, that regulatory attention is focused on national or site-specific risks or issues.

      The duration of export licences containing nuclear-related items should be increased to five years as standard, and consideration given to increasing this to ten years. There should be an adoption of a risk-based, proportionate approach to the level of information required as part of any application and record-keeping. This could mirror the risk-based approach adopted under the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds Regulations 2017. The overall aim of this should be to operate on a more generic basis, based on the actual risks involved.

      Applications for exports of the same items to any entity which has previously been granted an export licence should be decided within 28 days. If amendments to the Export Control Order 2008 are needed to give effect to these recommendations, that should be considered at the earliest opportunity.

      The ONR and EA should be granted ten year open licences which cover their regulatory activities in relation to its functions in collaborating with regulators.

      The Export Controls Joint Unit (ECJU) should establish a dedicated point of contact for nuclear companies and government teams involved in strategic nuclear export licensing. This resource should have the capability to engage meaningfully with nuclear specific matters in order to efficiently process licences in this area.

      Charging levels should be proportionate to inspector experience. There must be transparency around costs with narratives provided to licence applicants. There should be an allowance for the generation of surplus and for that to be reinvested into wider regulatory activities, including R&D and international engagement, that develop ONR capability and benefit the sector.

      Government should increase ONR's core grant to support international engagement in regulatory harmonisation and expertise in international nuclear technology and its regulation.

    text: |
      The government should explore contracting mechanisms that incentivise more proportionate solutions for delivering nuclear projects to ALARP. This should include financial incentives that place greater focus on the time, cost and trouble element of delivering ALARP.

      The Chancellor should write a letter to all regulators and industry operators to:
      - address the issues of gold-plating and commitments on how this can be remedied;
      - identify measures which can increase their risk appetite within the law;
      - what measures they are taking to communicate and drive the necessary culture change; and
      - where relevant, how contractual arrangements can be modified to ensure incentives are aligned with expeditious delivery.

      Responses should be provided within 6 months (i.e. September 2026).

    text: |
      There should be a clear process for releasing new sites for potential use. DESNZ should within a fixed 28 day period confirm whether it has any objections to the use of any site. The landowner (e.g. EDF or NDA) should then confirm within a 28 day period whether they will make the land available for use (subject to any necessary private agreements).

      If the approval is not provided, this should be clearly articulated to avoid abortive work. Approval should be automatic if a decision is not made within the time limit.
